## Drops Sample Code

This is a basic web-server developed with Node.js, Mongo DB and the Express framework. It allows users to register for [Drops](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/guides/drops/) and also processes their viewing activity. 

## Installation

1. Register your application for Drops on the [developer portal](https://devportal.twitch.tv/)
2. Create your game's channel on Twitch. Here we are using Twitch Drops Demo, which is currently offline. 
3. Replace channel name in drops-demo.html
4. Replace your end-point for viewing activity in index.js
